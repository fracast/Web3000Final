Our pages, who are in cache, 
Hello be thy name. 
Thy external libs come. 
Thy rendering be done 
On IE as it is on Chrome. 
Give us this day our daily JSON feed 
and forgive us our syntax 
as we forgive designers who have never coded.
Lead us not into frustration 
but deliver us from pre-compilers. 
For thine is the interface, the user experience, and the business logic 
Looping forever and ever.
in Java and C++.
